🧠 AI-Powered Neuroscience Research & Diagnostics Platform
🎯 Vision

A platform that automates neuroscience research and diagnostics using AI agents.
It ingests brain data (EEG/MRI) + clinical notes, analyzes them with ML/DL, connects to scientific literature, and produces automated research insights + diagnostic reports.

🏗️ Project Roadmap (Layered Scope)
Phase 1 – MVP (Core Platform)

Goal: Deliver a working prototype (demo-worthy) using EEG data.

Data Agent (EEG Preprocessing)

Dataset: CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset
 (seizure prediction).

Tasks: Noise filtering, normalization, segmentation into windows.

Analysis Agent (Seizure Detection)

Models:

Classical ML → SVM, RandomForest (baseline).

Deep Learning → RNN, LSTM, CNN on time-series.

Output: Probability of seizure onset.

Diagnostics Agent

Automated report generation with:

Detection result (e.g., “Seizure activity detected in channel X”).

Confidence score.

Visual EEG heatmap (Matplotlib).

Orchestrator Agent

Manages workflow: Data Agent → Analysis Agent → Diagnostics Agent.

Memory: Stores patient session in DynamoDB.

Demo Flow:
Upload EEG → AI detects seizure markers → Generates diagnostic report.

✅ Covers: Classical ML, DL, basic MLOps

Phase 2 – NLP & Knowledge Integration

Goal: Expand into text analysis + research support.

NLP Agent

Ingests clinical notes (doctor observations, symptoms).

Uses transformers (BERT/ClinicalBERT) for:

Symptom extraction.

Summarization.

Knowledge Agent

RAG pipeline: Query PubMed/arXiv for related neuroscience research.

Embedding search (via Bedrock embeddings).

Suggests possible hypotheses or related findings.

Demo Flow:
EEG + doctor notes → AI integrates results with recent PubMed studies.

✅ Covers: NLP, embeddings, information retrieval

Phase 3 – Generative AI Reports

Goal: Make the platform human-friendly with GenAI.

Report Generator Agent

Uses LLM (Bedrock Jurassic-2 / Claude / LLaMA) to:

Draft clinician-friendly diagnostic reports.

Create research abstracts linking results with literature.

Visualization

Brain heatmaps + interactive plots.

(Optional) Diffusion models for anomaly visualization (tumor/lesion maps).

Demo Flow:
EEG + notes → AI produces polished PDF-style report with graphs.

✅ Covers: Generative AI (text + images)

Phase 4 – Reinforcement Learning

Goal: Adaptive treatment & personalized research assistant.

Treatment RL Agent

Learns from feedback (e.g., doctor agrees/disagrees with report).

Adjusts recommendations (e.g., “Suggest further MRI”, “Schedule sleep study”).

Curriculum Optimization

RL agent optimizes feature/model exploration for research datasets.

Demo Flow:
User feedback (“wrong detection”) → AI adjusts future analysis.

✅ Covers: Reinforcement learning, feedback loops

Phase 5 – Full Deployment (MLOps)

Goal: Production-ready system.

Backend & APIs

FastAPI endpoints.

AWS Lambda + API Gateway for serving agents.

Model Hosting

Train/deploy models with SageMaker.

Store artifacts in S3.

Data & Memory

DynamoDB → Patient sessions.

S3 → EEG/MRI storage.

Monitoring

CloudWatch for logging.

Drift detection with EvidentlyAI.

Frontend

React dashboard: Upload data → View results → Download report.

✅ Covers: MLOps, deployment, observability

📊 Final Coverage of AI Domains

Classical ML → EEG classification (SVM, RandomForest).

Deep Learning → CNN (MRI), RNN/Transformers (EEG).

NLP → Clinical note summarization, literature mining.
