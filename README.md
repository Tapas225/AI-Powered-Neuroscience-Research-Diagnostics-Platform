## üéØ Vision

> A platform that automates neuroscience research and diagnostics using AI agents. It ingests brain data (EEG/MRI) and clinical notes, analyzes them with ML/DL models, connects insights to scientific literature, and produces automated research summaries and diagnostic reports.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion**: Processes EEG, MRI, and unstructured clinical notes.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes a full spectrum of AI‚Äîfrom classical ML to deep learning and generative AI.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates clinician-friendly diagnostic reports and research abstracts.
- **Knowledge Integration**: Connects findings with the latest scientific literature using RAG.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Incorporates a reinforcement learning loop for continuous improvement based on user feedback.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Roadmap

  - **Tasks**: Noise filtering, normalization, and segmentation.
- **Analysis Agent (Seizure Detection)**:
  - **Models**:
    - *Classical ML*: SVM, RandomForest (for baseline).
    - *Deep Learning*: RNN, LSTM, CNN on time-series data.
  - **Output**: Probability of seizure onset.
- **Diagnostics Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Automated report generation with detection results, confidence scores, and visual EEG heatmaps (Matplotlib).
- **Orchestrator Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Manages the workflow: `Data Agent` ‚Üí `Analysis Agent` ‚Üí `Diagnostics Agent`.
  - **Memory**: Stores patient sessions in DynamoDB.
- **Demo Flow**: Upload EEG ‚Üí AI detects seizure markers ‚Üí Generates a diagnostic report.
- **‚úÖ AI Domains Covered**: Classical ML, Deep Learning, Basic MLOps.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì NLP & Knowledge Integration
*Goal: Expand into text analysis and research support.*

- **NLP Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Ingests clinical notes and uses transformers (e.g., ClinicalBERT) for symptom extraction and summarization.
- **Knowledge Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Implements a RAG pipeline to query PubMed/arXiv for related research, suggesting hypotheses or findings via embedding search (Bedrock).
- **Demo Flow**: Upload EEG + doctor notes ‚Üí AI integrates results with recent PubMed studies.
- **‚úÖ AI Domains Covered**: NLP, Embeddings, Information Retrieval.

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Generative AI Reports
*Goal: Make the platform human-friendly with Generative AI.*

- **Report Generator Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Uses an LLM (e.g., Claude, Llama) to draft clinician-friendly reports and research abstracts linking results with literature.
- **Visualization**:
  - **Tasks**: Generates advanced brain heatmaps, interactive plots, and (optionally) diffusion models for anomaly visualization.
- **Demo Flow**: Upload EEG + notes ‚Üí AI produces a polished, PDF-style report with graphs.
- **‚úÖ AI Domains Covered**: Generative AI (Text & Images).

### Phase 4 ‚Äì Reinforcement Learning
*Goal: Create an adaptive, personalized assistant.*

- **Treatment RL Agent**:
  - **Tasks**: Learns from feedback (e.g., clinician agreement/disagreement) to adjust future recommendations.
- **Curriculum Optimization**:
  - **Tasks**: An RL agent optimizes feature/model exploration for new research datasets.
- **Demo Flow**: User feedback ("wrong detection") ‚Üí AI adjusts its analysis strategy for future cases.
- **‚úÖ AI Domains Covered**: Reinforcement Learning, Feedback Loops.

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Full Deployment (MLOps)
*Goal: Build a production-ready, scalable system.*

- **Backend & APIs**: FastAPI endpoints served via AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- **Model Hosting**: Train and deploy models with Amazon SageMaker, storing artifacts in S3.
- **Data & Memory**: DynamoDB for patient sessions and S3 for raw data storage.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logging and EvidentlyAI for drift detection.
- **Frontend**: A React dashboard for data upload, results visualization, and report downloads.
- **‚úÖ AI Domains Covered**: MLOps, Cloud-Native Deployment, Observability.

## üöÄ End Result

A single, comprehensive platform that is:
- **Demo-Ready**: Capable of running an end-to-end flow from EEG data to an automated diagnostic report.
- **Extensible**: Designed to easily integrate new data modalities (MRI, notes) and features (literature search).
- **Holistic**: Covers every major ML/AI domain in one meaningful, real-world application.
