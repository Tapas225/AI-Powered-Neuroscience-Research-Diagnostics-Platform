# AI-Powered-Neuroscience-Research-Diagnostics-Platform

🎯 Vision
A platform that automates neuroscience research and diagnostics using AI agents.
It ingests brain data (EEG/MRI) + clinical notes, analyzes them with ML/DL, connects to scientific literature, and produces automated research insights + diagnostic reports.
🏗️ Project Roadmap (Layered Scope)
Phase 1 – MVP (Core Platform)
Goal: Deliver a working prototype (demo-worthy) using EEG data.
Data Agent (EEG Preprocessing)
Dataset: CHB-MIT Scalp EEG dataset (seizure prediction).
Tasks: Noise filtering, normalization, segmentation into windows.
Analysis Agent (Seizure Detection)
Models:
Classical ML → SVM/RandomForest (baseline).
Deep Learning → RNN/LSTM/CNN on time-series.
Output: Probability of seizure onset.
Diagnostics Agent
Generates automated report with:
Detection result (e.g., “Seizure activity detected in channel X”).
Confidence score.
Visual EEG heatmap (Matplotlib).
Orchestrator Agent
Manages the workflow: Data Agent → Analysis Agent → Diagnostics Agent.
Memory: Stores patient session in DynamoDB.
Demo Flow: Upload EEG → AI detects seizure markers → Generates diagnostic report.
✅ Covers: Classical ML, DL, basic MLOps.
Phase 2 – NLP & Knowledge Integration
Goal: Expand into text analysis + research support.
NLP Agent
Ingests clinical notes (doctor observations, symptoms).
Uses transformers (BERT/ClinicalBERT) for:
Symptom extraction.
Summarization.
Knowledge Agent
RAG pipeline: Query PubMed/arXiv for related neuroscience research.
Embedding search (via Bedrock embeddings).
Suggests possible hypotheses or related findings.
Demo Flow: Upload EEG + doctor notes → AI integrates results with recent PubMed studies.
✅ Covers: NLP, embeddings, information retrieval.
Phase 3 – Generative AI Reports
Goal: Make the platform human-friendly with GenAI.
Report Generator Agent
Uses an LLM (Bedrock Jurassic-2 / Claude / LLaMA) to:
Draft clinician-friendly diagnostic reports.
Create research abstracts linking results with literature.
Visualization
Generates brain heatmaps + interactive plots.
Optionally, diffusion models for visualizing anomalies (tumor/lesion maps).
Demo Flow: EEG + notes → AI produces a polished PDF-style report with graphs.
✅ Covers: Generative AI (text + images).
Phase 4 – Reinforcement Learning
Goal: Adaptive treatment & personalized research assistant.
Treatment RL Agent
Learns from feedback (e.g., if doctor agrees/disagrees with report).
Adjusts recommendations (e.g., “Suggest further MRI”, “Schedule sleep study”).
Curriculum Optimization
For research datasets: RL agent optimizes which features/models to test first.
Demo Flow: User gives feedback (“wrong detection”) → AI adjusts future analysis.
✅ Covers: Reinforcement learning, feedback loops.
Phase 5 – Full Deployment (MLOps)
Goal: Production-ready system.
Backend & APIs
FastAPI for endpoints.
AWS Lambda + API Gateway to serve agents.
Model Hosting
Train/deploy models in SageMaker.
Store artifacts in S3.
Data & Memory
DynamoDB → Patient sessions.
S3 → EEG/MRI storage.
Monitoring
CloudWatch for logging.
Drift detection with EvidentlyAI.
Frontend
React dashboard: Upload data → See results → Download report.
✅ Covers: MLOps, deployment, observability.
📊 Final Coverage of AI Domains
Classical ML → EEG classification (SVM, RandomForest).
Deep Learning → CNN (MRI), RNN/Transformers (EEG).
NLP → Clinical note summarization, literature mining.
Generative AI → Automated reports, diagrams, visualizations.
Reinforcement Learning → Adaptive recommendations.
MLOps → Full AWS deployment (Bedrock + SageMaker + DynamoDB).
🧪 Suggested Datasets (Open Access)
